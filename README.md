Level 1 Task 1 -Thinking like a programmer: Pseudocode

Create a new text file called pseudo.txt.

● Inside pseudo.txt, write pseudo code for each of the following scenarios:

○ An algorithm that asks a user to enter a random letter. Repeat this
until the user inputs a number. Determine how many vowels were
given and output the total number of vowels.

○ An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers (whole
numbers (i.e. not fractional numbers) that can be positive, negative,
or zero) and then returns the average of all the even numbers and
the average of all the odd numbers.

○ An algorithm that reads a list of names and prints them out in
alphabetical order.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:
● Create a new text file called algorithms.txt.

● Inside algorithms.txt, write pseudocode for the following scenarios:

○ An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out “Hello” and the first_name.

○ The user then enters their age and then stores it in a variable called
age. Subsequently, the algorithm should work out the year the
person was born. The program should then print out the phrase
	@@ -34,8 +40,10 @@ you were born in 1998.”
## Optional Bonus

● Create a new text file called optional_task.txt.

● Inside the optional_task.txt file write the pseudocode for the algorithm
that asks the user for a number and stores that number in a variable
called n. The algorithm then works out if n is a prime number or not

● The algorithm then outputs either “Prime” or “Not prime” depending on
the result
